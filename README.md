# Artists Portfolio Website

Personal website designed to showcase the different art, and styles of art, created by the artist.

https://artbylynn.com/

Made using node.js, express with pug as the template language, and SASS.

Future updates may include an admin page for the artist to update the site, and a backend for store item information using MongoDB.

Design and concept made by me.
